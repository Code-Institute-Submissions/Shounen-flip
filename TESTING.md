##### **Part-1**  Testing client "user stories"

* As an external user I would like the controls to be easy so I can easily play the game. The controls are simple you literally have to click the face down cards to match them with each other. Any action excuted in this game  is done, more or less with one click . 

* As an external user I would like there to be instructions on how to play the game in order to quickly understand and play the game without having to spend time figuring out the controls and rules. The game has a button which specifies rules. 
* these rules explain to the player how to play and what must happen in order do to win/lose. 

* As an external user I would like to know when I have won the game. When the player wins a modal pop up occurs and displays text that says "You Win" furthermore it displays the players stats e.g rank, time and number of turns. 

* As an external user I would like to be able to restart the game if i make a mistake or lose. The game features a reset button which when clicked unflips the cards and resets the stats on the dashboard e.g Rank, Time and number of turns. 

* As an external user I would like to keep track of my score if this is applicable to the game. The game features a dashboard that displays the players stats. The stats displayed are the players Rank, Time and Number of turns.
