 **From the development stage to deployment stage.**
 
 I made some  changes during the decvelopment from the initial designs see in the wireframe mockups:
 * Homepage- I took out the extra links to the other pages on my site because I didn't want to cause information overload to the viewer by presenting too many options.
 * About me - originally i was going to make it so the image and the text box on the page would change positions as the screen size changed but I thought this was unnecessary and could be made simplier, so i kept the page the same even when the screen size changed. 
 * Blog - originally i was going to change the structure of the boxes on this page on the desktop view but decided against it because i wanted to keep the page simple, so i kept the structure the same even when the screen size changes.
